# Introduction
Toronto Weather and Bus is a simple web application with two main features:
* Displaying current weather in Toronto
* Predicting in real time when the next TTC bus of your choice will arrive

This web app is for Torontonians who are tired of switching between many platforms to know the weather and their bus time every morning before they leave the house. 

# Demo
Available [here] (http://tranglam.ca/wbApp/)

### To add a new route

## Limitations
* The app is only available online for now
* The app only tracks 3 routes at a time. If the app is already tracking 3 routes, user needs to remove an existing route to add a new one
* The app does not save any user input at the moment so refreshing/reloading the page will refresh the tracked routes to default routes (71 and 134)
* No min and max temperature (Iâ€™m looking for a new weather API to update this soon)
